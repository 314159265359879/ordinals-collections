  "description": "One of the earliest poetic collections inscribed as Ordinals Inscriptions on Bitcoin, and most probably the first collection of six-word stories inscribed for provenance. This is a small selection taken from arb 6ix Tales I wrote daily on Twitter between 2014 and 2018 to live on as digital artifacts.",
